# Starknet Token Remover

WIP example of a quite simple utility contract for Starknet

This repo requires `Scarb 0.5.0-alpha2`

## How does it work

- An accout sets a destination where they want funds to be transfered
- The accout gives approval for the contract to manage tokens
- When the contract receives

## Building

```
scarb build
```

## Testing

```
scarb test
```

## Running the scripts

The scripts use `starknet-rs` to interact with starknet.
